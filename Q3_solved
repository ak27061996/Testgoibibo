Question:
The King and poison wine bottle problem - that he has 1000 bottles of wine and one of them has been poisoned. He has only 15 prisoners. Logic to locate the poisoned bottle.


Answer:

we need ceil(log2(n)) prisoners required
As no of bottles is 1000, we distribute the bottle among each prisoners just as binary format,  either we give it or we dont. 

Lets number those prisoners as 1,2,3,...... 
Also each bottle is numbered 1 to 1000.
Now poison is distributed as 
1st bottle to prisoners 1 (binay 000000000000001)
2nd bottle to prisoners 2(000000000000010)
3rd bottle ro prisoners 1 and also prisoners 2(000000000000011)
4th bottle to prisoners 3(000000000000100) 
5th bottle to prisoners 1 and prisoners 3(000000000000101)
and
So on till 1000 bottles gets distributed 

Now no of prisoners died at the end of an hour can tell us which bottle is poisoned. 

For ex: if only prisoners no 1 and prisoners no 3 dies being rest alive we check at what no.  Only this two prisoners were served by same bottle, like here it is bottle no 5.

if 2nd and 1st dies and rest alive then bottle no. 3 has poison.

and so on..

Question:
Total number of squares in a chess board
    1. Provide number of edges that will be overlapped
    2. Provide number of edges that will not be overlapped if any

Answer:    
On a square board of n by n cells, there are
n^2 cells that form a square of size 1x1
(n-1)^2 cells that form the top-left corner of a square of size 2x2
(n-2)^2 cells that form the top-left corner of a square of size 3x3
and so on..
and in last 
2^2 cells that form the top-left corner of a square of size n-1 by n-1
1^2 cell that forms the top-left corner of the entire board of size n by n.

so total num of Squares: SUMMATION(square(1 to n))
4n edges will not be overlapped.
remaining will be overlapped.
